# Loom Loom!

System-agnostic TTRPG worldbuilding and session-management plugin for Obsidian. Tracks
characters, locations, factions, items, events, and sessions as markdown notes with YAML
frontmatter, plus typed relationships between them, visualized through a custom timeline
and a custom layered graph view.

> **Doc upkeep is part of finishing a task, not a separate chore.** Whenever files are
> added, moved, renamed, or a feature is completed, update the file map below,
> `ROADMAP.md`, and (for design changes) `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same change.

## File map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.ts` | Plugin entry: view/command/settings registration, .loom extension, legacy migration, project resolution for commands |
| `src/types.ts` | Entity types + metadata, record/connection/timeline/date shapes, view type IDs |
| `src/settings.ts` | Global settings: text size, tag vocabulary, graph node colors, collapse threshold; tabbed settings UI (General/Entities/Graph, per-project timeline settings under Graph) |
| `src/indexer.ts` | Index cache: project discovery (.loom files), frontmatter → in-memory records, vault event handling, connection queries (incl. native links), JSON snapshot persistence |
| `src/calendar.ts` | Date model: parsing (Gregorian + custom in-game calendars), display formats, per-project `ProjectConfig` (de)serialization |
| `src/columns.ts` | Chronological column layout shared by timeline and graph (sessions anchor columns, linked events stack beneath) |
| `src/project.ts` | Project scaffolding (.loom + folders), entity creation (managed session file names), setup/create/pick modals |
| `src/timeline-settings.ts` | Per-project timeline settings editor (date format + custom calendar), embedded in the settings tab's Graph tab, writes to the .loom file |
| `src/views/` | React views: home (FileView over .loom), entity page (FileView over .md), list, graph + shared shell/hooks. The timeline is not a view — it's a resizable bottom drawer inside the graph (`timeline-strip.tsx`). Entity pages embed collapsible connected-entity sections with in-place editing (`connected-entities.tsx`) |
| `src/graph/` | Graph-only logic: layered layout computation, connections side panel |
| `scripts/deploy.mjs` | Builds are copied to the test vault with `pnpm run deploy` |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Data flow, relationship model, calendar abstraction, design tradeoffs |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Feature checklist with code locations |

## Key architectural decisions

- **Storage**: markdown files + YAML frontmatter are the source of truth; one entity per
  `.md` file, native `[[wikilinks]]` so Obsidian's own backlinks keep working.
- **Projects are .loom files**: any folder holding a `<Name>.loom` file (JSON: per-project
  config — date format, custom calendar) is a project. The .loom file is the visible
  file-explorer entry point (registered extension, like .canvas/.base) and opens the
  React home view. Multiple projects per vault; views carry the project root in state.
- **Index cache**: `LoomIndexer` discovers projects, builds in-memory records from
  `metadataCache` frontmatter, updates incrementally on file events, and persists a
  debug/cold-start JSON snapshot. Indexing has no rendering concerns; views never re-scan files.
- **Link resolution is lazy**: records store unresolved linkpaths; resolution to files
  happens at query time via `metadataCache.getFirstLinkpathDest`, so renames/creations
  can't leave stale resolved paths.
- **Views**: all custom UI is React 18 mounted inside `ItemView`/`FileView` subclasses
  (`LoomReactView` / `LoomFileReactView` bases). Loom-internal clicks open the structured
  entity page view; opening the same .md from the file explorer gives the raw editor.
- **Names**: display name = file basename (renames propagate); no `name` frontmatter.
  Session file names are managed (`<Project> Session <date>`) and never shown in-app —
  sessions display their date.
- **Connections**: typed frontmatter relationships + `linkedSession` (one link or a
  list — events can span several sessions) + plain `[[links]]` anywhere in a note
  (relType `link`), all resolved bidirectionally; graph edges undirected. Entity tags
  live in `loomTags` (legacy `pluginTags` still read).
- **Dates**: `LoomDate` = raw string + packed sortable number + y/m/d + calendar id.
  Sessions always Gregorian; other entities use the project calendar (custom in-game
  months when enabled). Formatting is per-project config, never JS `Date`.

## Constraints

- **No Obsidian 1.13-only APIs** (`setDestructive`, `getSettingDefinitions`, …): 1.13 is
  Catalyst-only early access. `minAppVersion` stays 1.7.2 until 1.13 ships publicly.
  The typings package is 1.13, so a symbol existing in obsidian.d.ts does not mean it's
  safe to call — check when it was introduced.

## Workflow

- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + production bundle; `pnpm run lint` — Obsidian's ESLint
  rules (treat errors as build failures); `pnpm run deploy` — build + copy the three
  release files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) into the test vault at
  `~/Dropbox/Obsidian/Test Vault`. Deploy at every ready-to-test state.
- Releases ship exactly those three files, built by `.github/workflows/release.yml` when
  a GitHub release is created; `main.js` is never committed.

See `ROADMAP.md` for what's built vs. planned and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the deeper
"why" behind the design.
